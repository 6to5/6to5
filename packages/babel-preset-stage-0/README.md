# babel-preset-stage-0

> Babel preset for stage 0 plugins.

The gist of Stage 1 is:

> **Stage 1**: strawman
>
> **What is it?** A free-form way of submitting ideas for evolving ECMAScript. Submissions must come either from a TC39 member or a non-member who [has registered as a TC39 contributor](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/contribute_TC39_Royalty_Free_Task_Group.php).
>
> **Whatâ€™s required?** The document must be reviewed at a TC39 meeting (source) and is then added to [the page with stage 0 proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/stage-0-proposals.md).
