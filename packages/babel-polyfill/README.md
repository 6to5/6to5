# @babel/polyfill

> Provides polyfills necessary for a full ES2015+ environment

See our website [@babel/polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-polyfill.html) for more information or the [issues](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22pkg%3A%20polyfill%22+is%3Aopen) associated with this package.

## Install

Using npm:

```sh
npm install --save @babel/polyfill
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn add @babel/polyfill
```

> Because this is a polyfill (which will run before your source code), we need it to be a `dependency`, not a `devDependency`
