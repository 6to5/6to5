'loose' mode configuration must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled).
@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties has been set to `"loose": false` by @babel/preset-env, but it will be handled with `"loose": true` in order to be compatible with the other class features plugins.
