The installed version of "@babel/runtime" (^7.3.0) is lower than the version specified in "@babel/transform-runtime"'s options (7.5.0). For this reason, Babel will assume that some helpers are supported by the installed "@babel/runtime" version, even if they might not actually be present.
To fix this problem, you must specify the correct version in "@babel/transform-runtime"'s options:

    {
      "plugins": [
        [
          "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime",
          {
            "version": "7.3.0"
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
