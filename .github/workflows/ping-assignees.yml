            Hi, @${username}! It has been 2 weeks since your last update: are
            you still working on this issue?


            If you need any help, please ask either here or on
            [Slack](https://babeljs.slack.com/) (you can sign-up
            [here](https://slack.babeljs.io/) for an invite)!
            If you just need more time, please leave a comment here.


            If I don't get any response in one week, this issue will be
            unassigned so that other contributors can claim it.
